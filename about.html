        <h1>EcoGo Bottle Discription</h1>
        <p>Here is a discription of our water bottle.</p>
        <h1>Environmental Impact</h1>
        <p>Plastic water bottles have a significant negative environmental 
            impact due to the large amount of fossil fuels used in their production, 
            the generation of plastic waste that often ends up in landfills and waterways, 
            and the potential for microplastic pollution when they break down, harming 
            marine life and ecosystems; essentially, their entire life cycle contributes 
            to climate change and pollution.</p>
        <p>Reusable water bottles help the environment by reducing plastic waste, greenhouse 
            gas emissions, and pollution. One person using a reusable water bottle instead 
            of single-use bottles can prevent hundreds of bottles from ending up in landfills 
            each year. Reusing a bottle instead of buying a new one can significantly reduce 
            energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Reusable bottles can also help reduce 
            microplastics in the air and oceans, and stormwater pollution.</p>
